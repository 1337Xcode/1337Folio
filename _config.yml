title: Your Site
description: >-
  A minimal, reusable portfolio template built with Jekyll. Replace the values below to personalize the site.

baseurl: "/1337Folio" # Replace with your repository name if hosting on GitHub Pages under a project site; otherwise, leave as "" for other hosting.
url: "https://your-domain.example"

# Helpful placeholders (edit these first):
# - `site.owner.name` and `site.owner.email` are convenience fields used by
#   the HTML layout to populate visible defaults. You can also edit
#   `author.name` / `author.email` below â€” the layout prefers `site.owner.*` if present.
owner:
  name: "Your Name"
  email: "your-email@example.com"

# Author details for post outro
author:
  name: "Your Name"
  email: "your-email@example.com" # Replace with your contact email
  avatar: "/assets/images/avatar.jpg"
  bio: >-
    Brief bio about yourself. Replace this text with your own description.
  socials:
    - icon: "github"
      url: "https://github.com/yourusername"
    - icon: "envelope"
      url: "mailto:your-email@example.com"
    - icon: "linkedin"
      url: "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile"

# Notes:
# - Editing `_config.yml` is the canonical way to change site-wide values.
# - For quick edits without dealing with Jekyll, `_layouts/default.html` exposes
#   `window.SITE_OWNER` and `window.SITE_EMAIL` which the client-side scripts use
#   as fallbacks. If you change values here, rebuild the site with `bundle exec jekyll build`.
